# Computer Vision Nanodegree 

This repository contains project files for Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree program.

## Projects

### Facial Keypoint Detection

Use image processing techniques and deep learning techniques to detect faces in an image and find facial keypoints, such as the position of the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face.

Tools used: PyTorch, OpenCV


### Automatic Image Captioning

Combine CNN and RNN knowledge to build a deep learning model that produces captions given an imput image.

Tools used: Pytorch, Torchvision, NLTK


### Landmark Detection & Tracking (SLAM)

Implement Graph SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world

Tools used:
